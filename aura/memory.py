Aura Memory OS v2.1 — Three-Tier Persistent Memory for AI Agents.

Provides a cognitively-inspired memory architecture:
    /pad       - Working notepad (transient, fast writes)
    /episodic  - Session transcripts (auto-archived)
    /fact      - Verified facts (persistent, survives indefinitely)

v2.1 Performance Enhancements:
    - Temporal decay scoring (recent memories rank higher)
    - Noise filtering (blocks meta-questions and denials)
    - Entry deduplication (prevents redundant writes)
    - Bloom filters (skip irrelevant shards during query)
    - SimHash (fuzzy matching without embedding models)
    - Tiered priority scoring (facts > episodic > pad)

Install from PyPI to use:
    pip install auralith-aura

Usage:
    from aura.memory import AuraMemoryOS
    memory = AuraMemoryOS()
    memory.write("fact", "The auth module uses JWT tokens")
